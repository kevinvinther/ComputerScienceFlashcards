xxM[|/tFNr,"A {{c1::combinatorial proof}} of an identity is a proof that uses counting arguments to prove that both sides of the identity count the same objects but in different ways or a proof that is based on showing that there is a bijection between the sets of objects counted by the two sides of the identity. These two types of proofs are called {{c2::double counting proofs}} and {{c2::bijective proofs}}, respectively.",.,CS::DM551::Rosen::Chapter6::3
