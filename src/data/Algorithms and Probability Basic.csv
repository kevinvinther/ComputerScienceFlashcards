Suppose that a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. If there are \(n_1\) ways to do the first task and for each of these ways of doing the first task, there are \(n_2\) ways to do the second task, then there are \(n_1n_2\)  ways to do the procedure.

If a task can be done either in one of \(n_1\) ways or in one of \(n_2\) ways, where none of the set of \(n_1\) ways is the same as any of the set of \(n_2\) ways, then there are \(n_1 + n_2\) ways to do the task.",The Sum Rule,CS::DM551::Rosen::Chapter6::1
